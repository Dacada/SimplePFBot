Simple bot! No time for documentation! Go! Go! Go!

- Install python
- Create a virtual env
- Install dependencies
- Run the main script with the option to set up a basic config (run it with `--help` to see the option)
- Fill up the basic config
  - For the free slots, the only mandatory icons are `tank`, `healer`, `dps`, `dps_healer`, `dps_tank`, `healer_tank`, `dps_healer_tank`
  - To add custom emoji, enter `<:emoji_name:emoji_id>`, so something like `<:cir_bark:1289891643465400320>`
- Run the main script as many times as needed with the option to send the initial message (again, look at the help)
- Run the bot without options, which will loop continuously polling the source website and updating every sent message
- ???
- Profit!
